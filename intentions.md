Pimpampum has these intentions as a combat system:

- Classes should be balanced across all team variations. Individual class-vs-class matchups can be lopsided — some classes naturally counter others, and that's intended. What matters is that no class is consistently worse than all others when considering every possible team composition.
- All card types (attack, defense and focus) should be good enough to see balanced play.
- No card should be so good that it's the best choice every time.
- No card should be so bad it never sees play.
- Making good decisions should matter more than winning because of powerful cards.
- Anticipating others' plays should be greatly rewarded.
- Combo between cards played in the same turn should always be the best option, if played right. Players can agree beforehand on combos that they are going to play out during combat.
- Combats should be dynamic, not get stuck in the same move being repeated again and again.
- Combats should not be longer than 9 rounds on average.

## Strategy Triangle

The combat system follows a **Power > Protect > Aggro** strategy triangle:

- **Power** (focus-heavy play) beats **Protect** (defense-heavy play) — powerful buffs eventually overwhelm defensive play, since defense alone doesn't advance the win condition.
- **Protect** (defense-heavy play) beats **Aggro** (attack-heavy play) — defense cards are fast enough to reliably block attacks, and high base defense + armor makes raw attacks unlikely to land.
- **Aggro** (attack-heavy play) beats **Power** (focus-heavy play) — focus cards are very slow, so fast attacks hit before focus resolves, interrupting the effect entirely.

This triangle emerges from a key design mechanism: **focus cards are often high risk/high reward** — very powerful but very slow. This makes defense essential — the best move in the game is protecting an ally who is playing a high-impact focus card. A successfully resolved focus card swings the game dramatically, but it requires teammates to shield the caster from interruption. This creates meaningful team coordination: one player commits to a slow, high-impact focus while allies commit defense cards to ensure it resolves.

However, not all focus cards follow this pattern. Some focus cards are **quick to resolve and smaller in impact** — utility effects like dodges, minor buffs, or situational advantages that don't need the same level of team protection. These lighter focus cards add variety to the focus category and give players options that don't always demand a full team commitment to pull off.

The balance levers that maintain this triangle:
- **Focus power** — high enough that a resolved focus card is game-changing (e.g. F+1d6+2/V+3, V+4 team-wide for rest of combat)
- **Focus speed** — slow enough (V-5 to V-9) that most attacks resolve before focus does
- **Defense card speed** — fast enough (V+1 to V+6) to reliably intercept attacks before they land
- **Base defense + armor** — high enough that attacks without buffs rarely hit, making raw aggro unreliable
- **Attack dice** — small enough (1d4, 1d4-1) that unbuffed attacks struggle to penetrate defense

## Class Intentions

- Fighters (Guerrers) are versatile weapon masters with the widest attack variety. They're self-reliant (Second Wind), capable of burst damage (Action Surge), and team leadership (Battle Cry). Not tanks — the Paladin fills that role.
- Rogue are quick and utility based classes, specializing in combos.
- Wizards hit hard with their magic attacks, but are weak.
- Barbarians are aggressive berserkers who need team protection to set up, then dominate with raw physical power.
- Clerics are magic-based support classes with healing, curses, and spirit invocations. They blend offense and utility.
- Monks are fast, self-reliant martial artists who disrupt enemy strategies. They bypass defenses, silence focus plays, and reward precise, aggressive play. They are naturally Aggro-style (not Power+Protect) with mostly physical attacks and a defensive self-buff focus card.
- Bards (Trobadors) are versatile, performance-based support classes whose songs reshape the entire battlefield. Unlike the Cleric (who heals individuals and curses specific targets), the Bard's effects are sweeping and theatrical — team-wide buffs, AoE debuffs, and the game's only mind control mechanic (Charm). They're fragile and need allies to shield their slow performances, but a well-protected Bard is a force multiplier that makes any team composition stronger.

- Sorcerers (Bruixots) are fast, volatile magical glass cannons who trade life for overwhelming arcane power. They cast faster than any other caster but pay steep costs for their strongest abilities. Their Blood Magic focus card lets them sacrifice vitality for permanent magical power, and their Overcharge signature attack devastates enemies at the cost of self-inflicted wounds. They need healing allies to sustain their reckless playstyle.

- Paladins (Paladins) are stalwart holy warriors who combine martial combat with divine faith. They excel at protecting allies with their high defense and faith-powered shields, while their signature Divine Smite channels divine magic through their weapon for uniquely powerful strikes. Their Lay on Hands provides emergency healing and cleansing, and their Sacred Oath grants permanent combat empowerment. They reward patient, team-oriented play.

### Designing new classes and cards

- Start by fitting the decisions to the lore and style of the class. Base stats should be balanced against other classes.
- Cards should feel great to play and make sense from the skill/lore perspective. If a card is really powerful but doesn't fit the character style or its lore, then we should look first for something that actually fits, and then balance it so that it's a good enough card to see play.
- Look online for D&D (and other role playing games) character lore and skills, to draw inspiration from them. You can also search for stories from similar characters, and design cards based on special moments 
- Each class should have its own unique style and signature. Each of them must have a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses.
- Cards should be original, not feel like repetitions of existing cards. They should be balanced with the existing cards.
- Each class should have a "signature" card, that doesn't follow the normal style of cards in the game, but rather has a unique effect with a rather important impact in the game.
