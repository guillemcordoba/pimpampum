Pimpampum has these intentions as a combat system:

- Classes should be balanced.
- All card types (attack, defense and focus) should be good enough to see balanced play.
- No card should be so good that it's the best choice every time.
- Making good decisions should matter more than winning because of powerful cards.
- Anticipating others' plays should be greatly rewarded.
- Combo between cards played in the same turn should always be the best option, if played right. Players can agree beforehand on combos that they are going to play out during combat.
- Combats should be dynamic, not get stuck in the same move being repeated again and again.
- Combats should not be longer than 8 rounds.

- Fighters are good defensive classes, capable of protecting others, but slow and without being able to hit with that much damage.
- Rogue are quick and utility based classes, specializing in combos.
- Wizards hit hard with their magic attacks, but are weak.
- Barbarians are aggressive berserkers who need team protection to set up, then dominate with raw physical power.
