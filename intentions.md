Pimpampum has these intentions as a combat system:

- Classes should be balanced across all team variations. Individual class-vs-class matchups can be lopsided — some classes naturally counter others, and that's intended. What matters is that no class is consistently worse than all others when considering every possible team composition.
- All card types (attack, defense and focus) should be good enough to see balanced play.
- No card should be so good that it's the best choice every time.
- No card should be so bad it never sees play.
- Making good decisions should matter more than winning because of powerful cards.
- Anticipating others' plays should be greatly rewarded.
- Combo between cards played in the same turn should always be the best option, if played right. Players can agree beforehand on combos that they are going to play out during combat.
- Combats should be dynamic, not get stuck in the same move being repeated again and again.
- Combats should not be longer than 9 rounds on average.

## Strategy Triangle

The combat system follows a **Power > Protect > Aggro** strategy triangle:

- **Power** (focus-heavy play) beats **Protect** (defense-heavy play) — powerful buffs eventually overwhelm defensive play, since defense alone doesn't advance the win condition.
- **Protect** (defense-heavy play) beats **Aggro** (attack-heavy play) — defense cards are fast enough to reliably block attacks, and high base defense + armor makes raw attacks unlikely to land.
- **Aggro** (attack-heavy play) beats **Power** (focus-heavy play) — focus cards are very slow, so fast attacks hit before focus resolves, interrupting the effect entirely.

This triangle emerges from a key design mechanism: **focus cards are often high risk/high reward** — very powerful but very slow. This makes defense essential — the best move in the game is protecting an ally who is playing a high-impact focus card. A successfully resolved focus card swings the game dramatically, but it requires teammates to shield the caster from interruption. This creates meaningful team coordination: one player commits to a slow, high-impact focus while allies commit defense cards to ensure it resolves.

However, not all focus cards follow this pattern. Some focus cards are **quick to resolve and smaller in impact** — utility effects like dodges, minor buffs, or situational advantages that don't need the same level of team protection. These lighter focus cards add variety to the focus category and give players options that don't always demand a full team commitment to pull off.

The balance levers that maintain this triangle:
- **Focus power** — high enough that a resolved focus card is game-changing (e.g. F+1d6+2/V+3, V+4 team-wide for rest of combat)
- **Focus speed** — slow enough (V-5 to V-9) that most attacks resolve before focus does
- **Defense card speed** — fast enough (V+1 to V+6) to reliably intercept attacks before they land
- **Base defense + armor** — high enough that attacks without buffs rarely hit, making raw aggro unreliable
- **Attack dice** — small enough (1d4, 1d4-1) that unbuffed attacks struggle to penetrate defense

## Class Intentions

- Fighters are good defensive classes, capable of protecting others, but slow and without being able to hit with that much damage.
- Rogue are quick and utility based classes, specializing in combos.
- Wizards hit hard with their magic attacks, but are weak.
- Barbarians are aggressive berserkers who need team protection to set up, then dominate with raw physical power.
