Pimpampum has these intentions as a combat system:

- Classes should be balanced.
- All card types (attack, defense and focus) should be good enough to see balanced play.
- No card should be so good that it's the best choice every time.
- Making good decisions should matter more than winning because of powerful cards.
- Anticipating others' plays should be greatly rewarded.
- Combos between classes should be greatly rewarded  Players can agree beforehand on combos that they are going to play out during combat.
